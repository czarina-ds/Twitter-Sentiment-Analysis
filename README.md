# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

Business Problem
We have two options for our role and either is fine.
Option 1)We started a business where we help technology companies find ways to analyze tweets about their company and products. We have developed a model that helps social media departments filter through tweets that reference their company and/or their products and find potentially negative tweets so that they may then address them.
Option 2) We are digital brand advisors to the South by Southwest festival and possibly other technological conferences. Our goal in this analysis is to do a proof of concept measure of the effect of the Apple pop up tent on twitter sentiment at the 2011 SXSW festival. In 2011 Apple released the Ipad 2 at the SXSW festival which makes this an ideal situation for analyzing first impressions of a small group of people.

One reason why these attendees' tweets are important is that many of the attendees are influential, famous and wealthy and highly active on twitter and other social media platforms. Their thoughts can have an outsized impact on other people, especially as these are first impressions of new products like the Ipad 2. 

South by Southwest is primarily a film and music event and may not have expertise in analyzing social media postings but this measure of sentiment could help determine how much the event charges for booths, advertisements, and other commercial exposures. We are examining how effectively we can measure sentiment during such an event.


Understanding at a deeper level
One advantage of this analysis is that we can see what the first impressions of the product are. If tweets focus on one positive attribute that attribute can then be highlighted in media campaigns while negative twitter trends can be pushed back on before the criticism gains traction.

Expanding the places of analysis
SXSW is only one of many similar events which cater to affluent, famous personalities who directly influence people in the prime target advertising age range (25-40). Others include CES, IEEE, various Comic Cons, and Tech Talk. If this analytical method works here it should work in other venues as well.

In future situations we would also like to measure twitter sentiment before and after the event. This could be a measure of how well that event went and how effectively a product release went.
